      <description>Target The target site is completely free and public. While the site&amp;rsquo;s performance is sufficient it unfortunately isn&amp;rsquo;t well maintained: SSL cert is expired. Luckily the sought after information is available directly via REST calls. No html parsing necessary.
Process The scraping process was performed on a Cloud Compute, Regular Performance, $5/month VM on Vultr.com. The attached 120GB block storage was quickly expanded to 500GB, which increased the cost from $3.</description>

      <description>In the summer of 2023, I embarked on an ambitious journey to collect an extensive archive of historical images, totaling close to 2 million, from a public online repository. These captivating images capture typed or handwritten accounts of war experiences, predominantly in a single non-English language, although they encompass various other languages as well.
While I won&amp;rsquo;t disclose the name of the archive or share any documents here, I may provide some information in the future.</description>

      <description>Assumptions / Constraints We will operate on a dataset of 2,000,000 jpeg images / 500GB The initial budget is $1000. It is expected that this will increase, but the goal is to re-evaluate the budget prior to spending. We will operate using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) but might explore other cloud offerings when performance or cost become a concern System Design Scraping I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented scrapers using various languages including PowerShell, Node.</description>
