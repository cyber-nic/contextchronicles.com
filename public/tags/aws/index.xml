      <description>Context In an effort to learn more about the Google Cloud Platform, I built and deployed a website using Cloud Run functions, hosted behind a GCP Load Balancer. The performance was great. Even without conducting any performance or benchmark tests, I observed that the website was very responsive globally, as relayed by a family member in Singapore.
Unfortunately, the costs were not as favorable. The cost of running a single load balancer was about ~$25 per month.</description>
